# USAR-HAT
Running main.py will launch the simulated search and rescue scenario. 
Launching this file will ask you to first enter your preferred robot communication style: silent, transparent, adaptive, or explainable. 
Next, it will ask you to enter your preferred interdependence condition: tutorial, low, or high. Logs will be created for the low and high interdependence conditions.
